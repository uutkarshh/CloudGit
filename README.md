# CloudGit
CloudGit is a GitHub-like system that manages repositories with Git commands (init, add, commit, push, revert) using AWS for backend storage. It features user authentication, a UI connected to MongoDB Atlas, and AWS S3/IAM integration. Built with the MERN stack and Bootstrap, it simplifies version control with cloud integration.
